# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


##Lasles Landing Page Project

* **About**
* This project entails a front-end only website of a VPN site called LaslesVPN.
* It therefore does not have any functionalities at the moment, but I am looking forward to adding these functionalities in due time.

* **Challenges faced**
* I faced issues when creating the tesimonials section, particularly getting the cards right.
* At the getstarted section, the image is transparent, therefore when scrolling, it is in front of any other content, i.e the navbar.
* I will fix these issues promptly when I find solutions.

* **How I went about the project**
* I first built the React components and then worked on each component following a top-down approach.

* **Lessons learnt**
* Mostly came across  a wide range of styles therefore my CSS skills have been mostly improved.
